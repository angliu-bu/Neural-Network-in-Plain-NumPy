# Neural-Network-in-Plain-NumPy
Using high-level frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow or PyTorch allows us to build very complex models quickly. However, it is worth taking the time to look inside and understand underlying concepts. I make use of our knowledge and build a fully operational neural network using only NumPy, and also use it to solve a binary classification problems.
